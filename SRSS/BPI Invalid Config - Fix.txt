Open SQL Server Reporting Services Configuration Manager

Click on Web Service URL menu and make sure that the URL's match the ones located in Web Portal URL menu.

If they're different, open the rsreportserver.config file (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services\SSRS\ReportServer) and remove any entries not listed in Web Service URL.

Open your web portal ie. http://localhost/Reports and see if it's resolved. If so, all done.

If not, click the Encryption Keys menu, in the "Delete Encrypted Content" section, click "Delete".

Open your web portal again and see if it's resolved.

Locate and update your datasource credentials.
