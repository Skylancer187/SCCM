
Open MMC + Local Host Certificate Store. Request a new certificate, select SCCM Web Server (SHA256).
Requires Pri-CN and Alt-DNS to be the hosts FQDN!!!! I would recommend adding a Alt-IP.

After creating it, edit the Private Key permissions and add the SQL and SRSS Service accounts full permissions. Don't trust allowing just the Built-in Admins group.

Open edit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQLXX.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib
Edit the Certificate DWORD to blank (""), this forces SQL to use the next available PFX file that it can use.

Open "Report Server Config Tool" > Connect > Web Service URL > Advanced > Remove 443 > Add 443 with new Cert.
Press OK, then Apply at the bottom, it takes a while. If the cert is invalid or you're having host issues, try restarting the host and checking the cert again before attempting to bind again.
Binding can take 5-10 minutes.

Backup/Remove any certificates that are old. Failure to do so could force SQL to use an old cert.

RegKey Example: (Replace XX with the SQL version you're using)
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQLXX.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib]
"ForceEncryption"=dword:00000000
"HideInstance"=dword:00000000
"Certificate"=""
"ExtendedProtection"=dword:00000000
"AcceptedSPNs"=hex(7):00,00
"DisplayName"="SQL Server Network Configuration"

Restart MSSQLServer Service. Sometimes a reboot works best as there are a number of proccesses that rely on MSSQLServer.
